Hi there! 

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Sophie, a dedicated researcher and PhD student at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), where I've been a part of the Intelligent Software Systems group in the Institute for Software Technology (SC) since 2019. My academic journey in Artificial Intelligence began at TU Darmstadt, where I earned both my Bachelor and Master of Science degrees. It was during my Master's thesis with the AIML group in 2018 that I developed a deep fascination for the interplay between humans and machine-learning-based systems.

My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), investigating biases in machine learning model, and exploring Computational Humor. I am deeply intrigued by AI systems developed from natural human data and am committed to understanding how these systems capture and reflect human qualities in state-of-the-art models.

Thank you for visiting. Please feel free to browse through my publications, talks, and ongoing projects. Don't hesitate to reach out to me for any inquiries or collaborations! :)
